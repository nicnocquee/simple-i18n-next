title: Job Timeout
---

When you add a job to the queue, you can set a timeout for it. If the job doesn't finish before the timeout, it will be marked as failed.

When the timeout is reached, DataQueue does not actually stop the handler from running. You need to handle this in your handler by checking the `AbortSignal` at one or more points in your code. For example:

```typescript title="@lib/job-handlers.ts"
const handler = async (payload, signal) => {
  // Simulate work
  // Do something that may take a long time

  // Check if the job is aborted
  if (signal.aborted) {
    return;
  }

  // Do something else
  // Check again if the job is aborted
  if (signal.aborted) {
    return;
  }

  // ...rest of your logic
};
```

If the job times out, the signal will be aborted and your handler should exit early. If your handler does not check for `signal.aborted`, it will keep running in the background even after the job is marked as failed due to timeout. For best results, always make your handlers abortable if they might run for a long time.
