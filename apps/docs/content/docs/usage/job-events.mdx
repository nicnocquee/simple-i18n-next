title: Job Events
---

DataQueue keeps track of every change in a job's status. You can use `getJobEvents` to see all the events for a job, such as when it was added, started processing, completed, failed, cancelled, or retried.

```typescript tab="Code"
const events = await jobQueue.getJobEvents(jobId);
console.log(events);
```

```json tab="Output"
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jobId": 1,
    "eventType": "processing",
    "createdAt": "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z",
    "metadata": ""
  }
]
```
