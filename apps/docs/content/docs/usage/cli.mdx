## How to use the CLI

1. Create a `locales` directory in your Next.js or React Router project. This directory will contain the translation files in JSON format and Markdown files.
2. For each language you want to support, create a new directory in the `locales` directory. The name of the directory must be one of the [valid language codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). For example, if you want to support English, French, and Italian, you will create the following directories: `en`, `fr`, and `it`.
3. In each language directory, create a `messages.json` file. This file will contain the translations for the language. For example, you can create a `locales/en/messages.json` file that contains the following content:

```json title="locales/en/messages.json"
{
  "hello": "Hello",
  "welcome": "Welcome to {{name}}",
  "about": "About",
  "contact": "Contact",
  "coming_soon": "Coming soon"
}
```

and a `locales/de/messages.json` file that contains the following content:

```json title="locales/de/messages.json"
{
  "hello": "Hallo",
  "welcome": "Willkommen bei {{name}}",
  "about": "Über",
  "contact": "Kontakt",
  "coming_soon": "Bald kommen"
}
```

You can also add multiple JSON files in the same directory. For example, you can also have a `locales/en/client.json` file that contains the following content:

```json title="locales/en/client.json"
{
  "hello": "Hello",
  "welcome": "Welcome to {{name}}",
  "about": "About",
  "contact": "Contact",
  "coming_soon": "Coming soon"
}
```

If you do, you need to add the corresponding files in the other language directories.

4. Inside each language directory, you can also add several markdown files. For example, you can create a `locales/en/about.mdx` file that contains the following content:

```mdx title="locales/en/about.mdx"
# About

This is the about page.
```

and a `locales/de/about.mdx` file that contains the following content:

```mdx title="locales/de/about.mdx"
# Über

Diese Seite ist die Übersicht.
```

5. Finally, run the `npx simple-i18n-next` command in your project directory. This command will generate TypeScript code inside the `locales/.generated` directory that you can use in your React components.

6. You might need to add the generated directory to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "include": ["locales/.generated/**/*"]
}
```

7. Add the generated directory to your `.gitignore` file:

```text
locales/.generated
```

8. Update the package.json scripts to include the `simple-i18n-next` command and run it before the `dev` and `build` commands:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // [!code highlight:3]
    "generate-locales": "simple-i18n-next -i ./locales -l en",
    "dev": "npm run generate-locales && next dev",
    "build": "npm run generate-locales && next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "test": "npm run check && npm run test:vitest"
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  Note that if you don't specify the default language with the `-l` flag, the
  first directory in the `locales` directory will be used as the default
  language.
</Callout>
