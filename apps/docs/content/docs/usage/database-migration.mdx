title: Database Migration
---

After installing the package, add the following script to your `package.json` to apply [the migrations](https://github.com/nicnocquee/dataqueue/tree/main/packages/dataqueue/migrations):

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "migrate-dataqueue": "dataqueue-cli migrate"
}
```

Next, run this command to apply the migrations:

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue
```

This will apply all the necessary schema migrations so your Postgres database is ready to use with DataQueue.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Make sure the `PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE` environment variable is set to your
  Postgres connection string.** The CLI uses this environment variable to
  connect to your database. For example:

```dotenv
PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/my_database
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  **You must run these migrations before using the job queue.** For example, if
  you are deploying your app to Vercel, run this command before deploying in the
  Vercel's pipeline. If you have used Prisma or other ORMs, you may be familiar
  with this process.
</Callout>

### Using a custom .env file

You can use the `--envPath` option to specify a custom path to your environment file. For example:

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue -- --envPath .env.local
```

This will load environment variables from `.env.local` before running the migration.

### Schema selection

You can explicitly set the schema for migrations using the `-s` or `--schema` CLI option. This option is passed directly to `node-pg-migrate` and will ensure the schema is created if it does not exist.

**Example CLI usage with explicit schema:**

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue -- --envPath .env.local --schema dataqueue
```

<Callout>
  Specifying the schema is optional but **recommended** when you're using the
  same database as your main application. If you don't specify the schema, the
  CLI will use the default schema which is `public`. If you use
  [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io), the prisma migration will fail because of the
  additional tables added by DataQueue.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warn">
  You have to use the `--schema` option even when `PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE`
  contains the schema name in `search_path`.
</Callout>

### Other options

You can pass other options supported by `node-pg-migrate` to the migration command. For example:

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue -- --envPath .env.local --schema dataqueue --verbose
```

For more information, see the [node-pg-migrate documentation](https://salsita.github.io/node-pg-migrate/cli).

### Running migrations with SSL and a custom CA

Most managed Postgres providers (like DigitalOcean, Supabase, etc.) require SSL connections and provide a CA certificate (`.crt` file). You can use the CA certificate to validate the server's identity. In order to successfully run the migration with custom CA, you must set the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable to the path of your CA certificate. This tells Node.js to trust your provider's CA for outgoing TLS connections, including Postgres.

```bash
NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/absolute/path/to/ca.crt \
PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE=your_connection_string \
npm run migrate-dataqueue
```

#### Migration without Certificate Validation

For convenience, you can run the migration without certificate validation by adding the `--no-reject-unauthorized` flag to the command.

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue -- --no-reject-unauthorized
```

#### Using a CA certificate in environments where you cannot upload files

In some serverless or cloud environments (like Vercel, AWS Lambda, etc.), you cannot upload files directly, but you still need Node.js to trust your managed Postgres provider's CA certificate.

In this case, you can store the CA certificate as an environment variable and write it to a temporary file in your pipeline shell script before running the migration.

1. **Store the PEM content as an environment variable**
   - Copy the full contents of your `.crt` file into a new environment variable, e.g. `PGSSLROOTCERT_CONTENT`.
   - Make sure your environment supports multi-line secrets.
2. **Write the CA certificate to a file and set NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS in your pipeline script**

```sh
# Write the CA cert to a file
printf "%s" "$PGSSLROOTCERT_CONTENT" > /tmp/ca.crt
# Set NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS and run the migration
NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/tmp/ca.crt npm run migrate-dataqueue
```
