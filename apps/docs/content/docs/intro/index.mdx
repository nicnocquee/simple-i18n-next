This is a CLI to generate TypeScript code from translation files in JSON format and Markdown files for TypeScript React projects. It's been tested with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/home) projects.

## Why?

Making your React TypeScript project support multiple languages should be simple. There shouldn't be too much setup involved. The existing solutions for internationalization (i18n) like react-i18next are slightly too complicated, e.g., you need to instantiate an instance, add middleware, add helpers for the server side and client side, etc.

It should be as simple as providing a dictionary of translations and use it in your components. That's it.

## Features

- **Type-safe translation**. That means there will be build-time errors if you use a translation key that does not exist in a specific language.
- **Build-time error when missing translations**. Translation keys must cover all languages. As a result, an error message will appear if a translation for a specific language is missing. E.g., if you have 2 languages, and in one of them you have a translation for the key `hello`, but in the other one you don't, an error message will appear.
- **No JS code is sent to the client**. In React Server Components (RSC), the translations are generated inline during build time, so no JS code is sent to the client.
- **Only necessary translations are sent**. When using the generated `useStrings` hook in client components to dynamically get localized strings, only the requested translation strings are downloaded. No useless data transfer!
- **Markdown or MDX files are supported**. You can use Markdown or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) files for each language.
- **Pluralization support** with a simple syntax.
- **Support for nested keys in the JSON files**.
- **Support for multiple JSON files**.

## What this CLI is not or does not do

- **It does not have language detection**. You need to pass the language code to the generated functions. You can easily get the language code from the URL pathname if you follow the [Internationalization documentation of Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/internationalization#routing-overview).
- **It does not support various localization sources.** You can only use JSON files and Markdown files.
