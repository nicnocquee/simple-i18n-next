This is basically what the CLI does:

1. The CLI will search for all the JSON files in the `locales` directory.
2. It will then create TypeScript functions for each translation key.
3. You use the generated functions in your components.

## Example Directory Structure

```text
locales/
  en/
    messages.json
    about.mdx
    client.json
  de/
    messages.json
    about.mdx
    client.json
```
