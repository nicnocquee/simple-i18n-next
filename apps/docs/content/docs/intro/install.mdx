title: Installation
---

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed in your environment. And obviously, you need a Postgres database.

You can install the required libraries using your favorite package manager, such as npm:

```package-install
npm install @nicnocquee/dataqueue
npm install -D node-pg-migrate ts-node
```

You need to install <code>node-pg-migrate</code> and <code>ts-node</code> as development dependencies to run database migrations.
