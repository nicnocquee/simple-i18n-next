title: JobHandlers
---

The `JobHandlers` type defines a map of job types to their handler functions. Each handler processes a job's payload and receives an `AbortSignal` for cancellation.

## Type

```ts
type JobHandler<PayloadMap, T extends keyof PayloadMap> = (
  payload: PayloadMap[T],
  signal: AbortSignal,
) => Promise<void>;

// Map of job types to handlers

export type JobHandlers<PayloadMap> = {
  [K in keyof PayloadMap]: JobHandler<PayloadMap, K>;
};
```

## Example

```ts
const handlers = {
  email: async (payload, signal) => {
    // send email
  },
  generateReport: async (payload, signal) => {
    // generate report
  },
};
```
