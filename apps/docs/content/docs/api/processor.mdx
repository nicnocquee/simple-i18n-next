title: Processor
---

The `Processor` interface represents a job processor that can process jobs from the queue, either in the background or synchronously.

## Methods

### startInBackground

```ts
startInBackground(): void
```

Start the job processor in the background. This will run continuously and process jobs as they become available. It polls for new jobs every `pollInterval` milliseconds (default: 5 seconds).

### stop

```ts
stop(): void
```

Stop the job processor that runs in the background.

### isRunning

```ts
isRunning(): boolean
```

Check if the job processor is running.

### start

```ts
start(): Promise<number>
```

Start the job processor synchronously. This will process jobs immediately and then stop. Returns the number of jobs processed.
